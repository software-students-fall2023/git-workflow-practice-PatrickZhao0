## The [Article](https://www.coursera.org/articles/software-engineer) I find Interesting: What Does a Software Engineer Do?
The article provides an in-depth look into the role of software engineers. These are the professionals who design, create, and maintain the software and apps we frequently use on our computers and smartphones. The field of software engineering is broad, with two primary categories: systems developers and application developers. Systems developers work on the underlying systems that support apps, while application developers focus on creating the apps themselves, whether for mobile devices or computers. The article emphasizes that a career in software engineering is not only fulfilling due to the problem-solving nature of the work but also offers competitive salaries and job flexibility.

I think that this article serves as an excellent resource for anyone curious about the world of software engineering and the different career paths within the field that often go unnoticed. What stood out the most to me, however, is the section of what people hate/love about their SE career, as the negatives are often not openly discussed or taken into consideration.
